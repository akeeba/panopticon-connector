## ‚ÑπÔ∏è What is this?

This is the connector component for [Akeeba Panopticon](https://github.com/akeeba/panopticon), our self-hosted site monitoring software. You need to install it on your site to be able to monitor it with Akeeba Panopticon.

‚ÑπÔ∏è If you have a Joomla! 3 site please [look at the Joomla 3 connector's repository](https://github.com/akeeba/panopticon_connector_j3/releases/latest) instead.

## üîé Release highlights

* **‚ú® Troubleshooting aid for API application errors when connecting a Panopticon site**. Have you ever tried to connect a site to Panopticon, only to receive an error saying the API application doesn't work? In almost every case it's a third party plugin which is written incorrectly so that it either breaks the API application outright, or is not fully compatible with the Joomla! or PHP version you're using. Until now, it was really hard figuring out which plugin was the problem, and how to contact its developer. Not any more! We introduced a new system plugin which automatically catches the error condition, identifies the offending plugin, and reports this information back to you when you try to connect a site to Panopticon, or using its Connection Doctor!

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

* Joomla! 4.0, 4.1, 4.3, 4.3, 4.4, 5.0, and 5.1.
* PHP versions 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 (PHP 8.1 or later required for Joomla! 5)

## üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª Important note about the Joomla! API

Akeeba Panopticon Connector uses the Joomla! API application (the `/api` folder on your site). Around February 2023 there was a lot of unnecessary panic, leading some people to disable access to this folder through their `.htaccess` file. If you did that, you need to undo that change to re-enable access to the `/api` folder.

When Akeeba Panopticon connects to sites running on Joomla! 4 and later it makes use of code provided not only by its own connector, but also core Joomla! plugins in the `webservices` and `api-authentication` folders. Please make sure that the following plugins are enabled on your site:

* `Web Services - Panopticon` (provided by this connector).
* `Web Services - Installer` (provided by Joomla!).
* `API Authentication - Web Services Joomla Token` (required for secure, token-based authentication to the Joomla! API).

If any of these plugins are disabled, _or if its Access is set to anything other than Public_, you will run into connection problems with your site. The connector itself will try to detect and report these issues, but there are cases it might fail to identify the problem.
