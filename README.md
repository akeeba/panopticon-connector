# Akeeba Panopticon Connector

The Joomla 4.x connector package for Akeeba Panopticon.

## What is it?

This package needs to be installed on Joomla sites which will be managed by Akeeba Panopticon. It provides the JSON API routes used by Akeeba Panopticon to retrieve information about software installed on the site and perform maintenance operations on it.

## WORK IN PROGRESS

This is work in progress. It will take a while before it's in a usable state. The target for stable release is Q2 2024, depending on the breadth and depth of changes in upcoming Joomla and PHP versions.

## Building from sources

**TODO: Expand on this**

Install Akeeba BuildFiles one level up, on `buildfiles`

Run `phing git` in the repo's root.

Requires Composer and Phing to be already installed.
